# GraphOne

AI intelligence platform tracking the company/investor/funding-round graph. Monorepo with a Node.js/TypeScript/Express API (`server`) and a Next.js frontend (`client`).

**Scope of v1:** Companies, Investors, and Funding Rounds — the core entity graph. Founders and News are intentionally deferred to a follow-up pass (see "What's not in v1" below).

Data is hand-curated seed data for now. A crawler/ingestion pipeline is planned as phase 2.

## Project structure

```
graph-one/
├── client/          # Next.js frontend
├── server/          # Express API + Supabase
│   ├── src/
│   └── supabase/migrations/
├── package.json     # root scripts only (concurrently)
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

`client` and `server` are independent apps with their own `package.json`, `node_modules`, and `.env`. They don't import each other — the client talks to the server purely over HTTP.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (built and tested on Node 22)
- A Supabase project (free tier is fine) — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

## 2. Setup

From the **repo root**:

```powershell
npm install
```

This installs `concurrently`, used to run both apps with one command.

### Server setup

```powershell
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `server/.env` and fill in your Supabase project's URL and **service role** key (Project Settings → API in the Supabase dashboard), plus the client's URL for CORS:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=4000
```

> ⚠️ The service role key bypasses Row Level Security. It must only ever live in `server/.env` — never ship it to the frontend/browser bundle.

### Client setup

```powershell
cd client
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `client/.env.local` to point at the server:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## 3. Create the database schema

Open the Supabase SQL Editor for your project and run the contents of:

```
server/supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql
```

This creates the `companies`, `investors`, `funding_rounds`, and `round_participants` tables, their indexes, the `updated_at` triggers, and read-only RLS policies.

## 4. Seed the database

From `server/`, sanity-check the seed data first (pure offline check, no DB calls):

```powershell
npm run validate-seed
```

Then actually seed Supabase:

```powershell
npm run seed
```

This upserts ~47 companies, ~21 investors, and ~46 funding rounds (with lead + participant investors wired up), and recalculates each company's `total_funding_usd` / `last_funding_at` and each investor's `portfolio_count`. Safe to re-run — companies/investors are upserted by slug, and funding rounds for seeded companies are cleared and re-inserted each time so you never get duplicates.

## 5. Run the app

**Option A — both at once, from the repo root:**

```powershell
npm run dev
```

This uses `concurrently` to start the server and client together, with `[SERVER]`/`[CLIENT]` prefixed, color-coded log output.

**Option B — separately, in two terminals:**

```powershell
# Terminal 1
cd server
npm run dev      # ts-node-dev, auto-reload

# Terminal 2
cd client
npm run dev
```

- API: `http://localhost:4000` (health check: `GET /health`)
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

## How the client and server connect

They're two separate processes — there's no shared import or build step. The client makes plain HTTP requests to the API using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. The server allows those cross-origin requests via CORS, configured with `CLIENT_URL` in `server/.env`. In production, you'd point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` at your deployed API URL and `CLIENT_URL` at your deployed frontend URL.

## Architecture notes

- **Why a Node API instead of hitting Supabase directly from the frontend?** Centralizing reads/writes here lets us enforce validation (Zod schemas), keep complex multi-table writes (funding round + participants + denormalized counters) atomic-ish and consistent, and avoid ever shipping the service role key to a browser. RLS policies are in place as a backstop, not the primary access control.
- **Denormalized fields** (`companies.total_funding_usd`, `companies.last_funding_at`, `investors.portfolio_count`) are recalculated from source tables on every write that could affect them, rather than trusted as input. This trades a bit of write-time cost for read-time correctness, which matters more for a dashboard product.
- **Validation** happens at the edge (Zod, in `server/src/types/*.schema.ts`) before any DB call, so malformed input never reaches Supabase.
- **CORS** is scoped to `CLIENT_URL` only — not wildcarded — since the service role key's blast radius means the API shouldn't casually accept requests from arbitrary origins.

## What's not in v1 (planned next)

- Founders entity + company/investor ↔ founder relationships
- News entity + ingestion
- Real crawler/data pipeline (current data is hand-seeded)
- Auth (currently all endpoints are open — fine for a prototype, not for production multi-tenant use)
